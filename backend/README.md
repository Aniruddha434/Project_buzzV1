# ProjectBuzz Backend

This directory is intended for the backend code of the ProjectBuzz application.

Currently, the backend functionality is handled by Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage), so there is no separate custom backend server code in this directory yet.

Future backend services or Cloud Functions could be added here.
