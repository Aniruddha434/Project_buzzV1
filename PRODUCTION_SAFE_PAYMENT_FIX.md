## ✅ **Issue Fixed for Production Users**

The "You already have a pending payment for this project" error has been resolved with a production-safe solution that gives users control over their payment flow without breaking existing functionality.

---

## 🔧 **Production-Safe Changes Made**

### **1. ✅ Backend Improvements (Safe for Live Users)**

#### **Reduced Payment Expiry Time:**
```javascript
// OLD: 30 minutes expiry
expiryTime: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 60 * 1000)

// NEW: 10 minutes expiry (faster cleanup)
expiryTime: new Date(Date.now() + 10 * 60 * 1000)
```

#### **Enhanced Error Response:**
```javascript
// Now provides more helpful information
{
  success: false,
  message: 'You already have a pending payment for this project',
  data: {
    orderId: "ORDER_123...",
    status: "ACTIVE",
    timeRemainingMinutes: 8,
    canCancel: true  // ← New: User can cancel
  }
}
```

#### **New User-Controlled Cancellation Endpoint:**
```javascript
POST /api/payments/cancel-pending
{
  "projectId": "project_id_here"
}
```

### **2. ✅ Frontend Improvements (Better User Experience)**

#### **Enhanced Existing Payment Dialog:**
- ✅ **Clear information** about pending payment
- ✅ **Time remaining** display
- ✅ **"Cancel & Retry" button** for user control
- ✅ **Professional UI** with proper styling

#### **Improved Payment Service:**
- ✅ **Better error handling** with enhanced data
- ✅ **Cancel pending payment** method
- ✅ **Automatic retry** after cancellation

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **User Experience Flow:**
```
1. User clicks "Buy Now"
2. If pending payment exists:
   → Shows dialog with payment info
   → User sees time remaining
   → User can choose:
     a) "Cancel & Retry" → Cancels old payment, starts new one
     b) "Close" → Dismisses dialog
3. If no pending payment:
   → Normal payment flow continues
```

### **Backend Logic:**
```
1. Check for existing payments
2. If found and not expired:
   → Return enhanced error with cancellation option
3. If found and expired:
   → Auto-cleanup expired payment
   → Continue with new payment
4. If none found:
   → Create new payment order
```
